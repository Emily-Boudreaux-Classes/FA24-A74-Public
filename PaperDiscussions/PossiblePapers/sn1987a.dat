Questions to post for the students:
What is syncrhotron radation?
How exactly do they go from measurement of fluxes at four wavelnegths 
to dust masses and temperatures? 
Why consider three different types of dust grains 
(astronomical silicates, amorphous carbon & iron)?
What do they mean by an infrared echo (middle column page 1260)?
