    "## Installation of Jupyter, Tools for Use, and Gasses\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intro\n",
    "Throughout this course there will be a few projects which use Jupyter Notebook and Python. Moreover, you are encouraged (but *not* required) to use these same tools to solve certain homework problems. For those unfamiliar, Jupyter notebook is a very helpful tool originally built to integrate text and code together in one document. The following will be a introduction to jupyter and python assuming little to no foreknowledge of these tools. If you have experience using them feel free to skip ahead to the section labeled **Installation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jupyter & Python\n",
    "Jupyter itself is an application which you access through a web browser, jupyter *is not* a programming language. Instead, jupyter connects to what are called kernels. These are seperate applications which evaluate code from various languages. Most often (and always in this class) we will use jupyter with a python kernel. This means that we will write code in jupyter, and then when we ask jupyter to evaluate a code cell that cell is sent off to the python kernel for evaluation. This then begs the question, what is python.\n",
    "\n",
    "A computer science heavy definition of Python is a high-level multi-paradigm dynamically-typed interprited language. A more useful definition for us is that python is the current lingua franca of Astronomy. That is to say that for approximalty the last 10 years almost all professional astronomy has been done, in some way in Python. In order to operate in the world of astronomy today **knowing how to use Python is a key skill**. That is not to say that *all* astronomy software is written in python. Fortran and C still hold important places when it comes to high performance simulations while IDL and IRAF scripting still exist in a limited sense. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we ask ourselves why Python is so dominate in the field we have to contend with the fact that its dominace is relativley recent. Up and until 10 years ago C, Fortran, IDL, and IRAF were far more important in day to day astornomy (and not just for data-reduction pipelines or intense numerical simulations). Why then did these established languages get displaced by python? It is not because python brings a performance increase. In fact of all the languages given python is by far the least performant. Instead, python brings an ease of use increase. Python code is, generally, far easier to write and to read than equivilent C or Fortran code would be. This turns out to be a tradeoff which many, many ,many astronomers have decided is acceptable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter developed somewhat in step with python's adoption by the community (not just in astronomy but in the wider scientific commiunity, though astronomers played a large role in Jupyter development). Jupyter developed as a way to integrate text (such as what you are currently reading) into the same document as code. Jupyter uses a **cell model** where each cell can be either a **markdown cell** which contains formated text or a **code cell** which contains some code to be evaluated. This is useful when you want to tell a story where code is a large part. What I find is the other important use of Jupyter is as a **visual and dynamic code editor**. That is to say that in jupyter visualizations are rendered in-line instead of opening in a seperate window. This does mean that you do not have the ability to pan, scroll, or zoom on them (as they are litterally rendered to a png and then that png is embedded into the webpage); however, I find having those visualiations right next to the code actually lets me iterate and explore faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use Jupyter you interact with a file called a notebook (*.ipynb files). These can be opened with a number of programs such as the original Jupyter Notebook, the more modern Jupyter Lab (which is what I reccomend you use for this class), or even more traditional text editors such as VS code which contain plugins to emulate the cell like behavior of jupyter. Below I provide instructions for installing and using **Jupyter Lab**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation\n",
    "The installation instructions will change somewhat from system to system. In general they will probably be a bit simpler on a mac or linux system and a bit more involved on a windows system. I will try my best to provided installation assistance to windows users; however, I am simply not familar with those systems. If after a decent effort you are unable to install jupyter lab on windows either come to my office hours or email me and I will work on it. If that does not work I will likeley direct you to John Griffen, the Department of Physics and Astronomy's IT proffessional who will be more qualified to help. \n",
    "\n",
    "I recomend installing the python distribution and package manager **<a href=\"https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/\">anaconda</a>** which will package everything you need in order to use python and jupyter in this class. The link provided should detail how to install anaconda on various systems. **DURING INSTALLATION ANSWER YES TO ANY PROMPT ASKING IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO ADD ANACOND TO YOUR SHELL OR IF YOU WANT TO INITIALIZE CONDA**. Anaconda will install a version of python on your system and then tell your system to prefer that version over any previously installed version of python. If you don't want to use anaconda that is *okay* you can either install jupyter on your own or come to me and we can work on installing it without anaconda. That being said, the following instructions will assume that anaconda has been installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, check to make sure the version of python you are using is from anaconda (all of these slightly indented code blocks are meant to be run in a terminal emulator, on mac by default this is called term, linux distros all have some varient of this, and I belive similar things can be done from CMD on windows).\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "which python\n",
    "```\n",
    "this should print out something like `/User/username/anaconda3/bin/python`. If it does not then close your terminal emulator and the reopen it (or resource your profile file). Next we are going to install jupyter and ipython (which is the python kernel jupyter will use) using the python package manager (pip). \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install ipython\n",
    "pip install jupyterlab\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, assuming you did not get any error messages, you should be set to go. In order to use jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "jupyterlab\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This should automatically open a browser and redirect it to a local address. Jupyter is actually running a local webserver which your computer is then connecting to. Within jupyter lab you can browse to different locations on your computer using the file browser in the side bar, create new notebooks by clicking the blue + button at the top of the sidebar, or make new folders with the + folder icon in the same place. When you click the blue plus you will be asked to choose a kernel. You likley only have one avalible, so select that. Now, finally, you are in a jupyter notebook. **At this point I recomend opening the \\*.ipynb version of this file (as opposed to the pdf version) so you can follow along in jupyter.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting Started\n",
    "There are a few python modules (external code written by others) which we are going to use in this project. These can all also be installed with the python package manager. We will need\n",
    "\n",
    "1. numpy (general math and array tools)\n",
    "2. matplotlib (graphing and visualization)\n",
    "3. scipy (more advanced numerical models)\n",
    "4. astropy (astronomy specific tools)\n",
    "5. astroquery (access to astronomy datasets)\n",
    "6. pandas (more complex data tables)\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these are likeley already installed (as they come with anaconda by default); however, just to make sure run `pip install ...` for each of them (i.e. `pip install numpy`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once those are all installed you can use them in the notebook which you already created."

    "\n",
    "Astropy is a package designed by and for astronomers. We'll use two modules from astropy, which we'll import directly. Here, we'll be using the astropy \"units\" module to keep track of units for us. This is extremely convenient because it allows us to convert between units, and keep track of our units, automatically. From personal experience, there can be huge problems if you get this wrong. As a warning, you do need to make sure you have the units you want before using the value somewhere that you aren't keeping track of units. \n",
    "\n",
    "After this project I will **not** require the use of astropy units; however, I do encorage you to use them as they really do help prevent some simple mistakes (note that in certain circumstances they can complicate things and it might make sense to not use them, in those cases you just need to be extra careful about tracing your units manually)"
