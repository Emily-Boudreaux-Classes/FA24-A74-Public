    "# Class Work - Fourier Transforms\n",
    "This notebook will be a breif introduction to Fourier Transforms (FT) and their uses in astronomy. The Fourier Transform is one of the most important tools in any sort of signal processing you might be carying out. Developed in the early 1800s to aid in the describe the flow of heat, the Fourier transform allows you to break down *any* signal as a series of sine waves. The math behind how this works is interesting but not strictly nessisarity to understand (i.e. you can, to an extent, treat a FT as a black box). The key concept to recognize with a FT is that it transforms your data from the time-domain to the frequency-domain. That is to say that if your data represents a seriese of measurments through time (such as a light curve in astronomy) the FT of that data will represent the contributing power of frequencies for that signal. A peak in the FT at some frequency means that frequency strongly contributes to the overall shape of the signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "**N.B.** I will refer to a Fourier Transform, Fourier Series, and periodigram interchangably here. They are not strictly the same thing (as a FT is a continuous operation and a FS is a series expansion). Really what we will be doing here is a Lombscargle Periodogram. While this distinction *is* important in some fields for the purpose of astronomy the terms may generally be used interchangably. One practical difference is how these two methods deal with sampling and generality. A periodigram can handle unevenly spaced data wherease a FT can generally not.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building a periodigram\n",
    "Included in this class work there is a file called lc.dat. Read this file in with python. You can use any parsing scheme you want; however, I reccoment pandas here. After you read in the data plot it so you can see what it looks like in the time domain."

    "Now we need to bring in the libraries for computing the periodigram. Both scipy and astropy include periodigram methods. Here we will use the Lombscargle periodigram from astropy (mostly cause it is a bit more user friendly). The scipy routine can sometimes be more general so that is good to be familar with as well."
